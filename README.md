# Pneumonia-Classification

Worked on a deep learning-based method using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 for binary classification for Pneumonia. It employed a combination of cross-entropy and focal loss functions to address class imbalance, achieving an accuracy of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.97. This approach offers a robust solution by effectively identifying Pneumonia while mitigating issues related to imbalanced data in the dataset.
