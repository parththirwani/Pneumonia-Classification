# Pneumonia-Classification

Worked on the dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Due to imbalance of data between classes and this approach offers a robust solution by effectively identifying Pneumonia while mitigating issues related to imbalanced data in the dataset.

Worked on a deep learning-based method using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 for binary classification for Pneumonia. It employed a combination of cross-entropy and focal loss functions to address class imbalance, achieving an accuracy of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.97.
